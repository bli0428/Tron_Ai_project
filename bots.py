            asp - an AdversarialSearchProblem
            cutoff_ply - an Integer that determines when to cutoff the search and
                use heuristic_func. For example, when cutoff_ply = 1, use
                heuristic_func to evaluate states that result from your first move.
                When cutoff_ply = 2, use heuristic_func to evaluate states that
                result from your opponent's first move. When cutoff_ply = 3 use
                heuristic_func to evaluate the states that result from your second
                move. You may assume that cutoff_ply > 0.
            heuristic_func - a function that takes in a GameState and outputs a
                real number indicating how good that state is for the player who is
                using alpha_beta_cutoff to choose their action. You do not need to

                calling alpha_beta_cutoff, however you are welcome to write
                evaluation functions to test your implemention. The heuristic_func
                we provide does not handle terminal states, so evaluate terminal
                states the same way you evaluated them in the previous algorithms.
